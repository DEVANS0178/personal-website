    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>I am self-motivated, passionate, responsible and a very hard working person. 
        Even through difficult work I can eventually adapt to it and stay positive to get the objective done. 
        I plan to use the skills that I have as a strong 
        suit to continue this major as a career. 
        I have gained knowledge on those skills since 2020 when I first enrolled to Jefferson Community & Technical College.</p>
